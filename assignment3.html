          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
          industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
          since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
          scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
        </div>

        <input
          class="input"
          type="radio"
          id="second"
          name="pop"
          value="second"
        />
        <label class="second" for="second"> SECOND</label>
        <div class="text">
          <span class="font">SECOND</span>
          <br />It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
          electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
          popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
          containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
        </div>

        <input class="input" type="radio" id="third" name="pop" value="third" />
        <label class="third" for="third">THIRD</label>
        <div class="text">
          <span class="font">THIRD</span>
          <br />It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted
          by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The
          point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
          distribution of letters, as opposed to using
        </div>
